### A Visual IDE for React Projects

Codux is an all-in-one visual development environment. Whether youâ€™re starting a new app, creating components, or editing an existing project, every visual change you make reflects instantly in the code and vice versa. To learn more about Codux, visit our website - [https://www.codux.com/](https://www.codux.com/)

### Take it for a Spin

This project provides an interactive playground for the [Bluprint.js](https://blueprintjs.com), React-based UI toolkit. It's a great way to explore how the library and Codux work.

This project was bootstrapped with [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

- Learn how to edit, render and compose apps that make use of [@blueprintjs](https://blueprintjs.com/docs) components.
- Create **`React`**-based components with **`TypeScript`**, **`SCSS`** and **`CSS Modules`** support.
- Visually edit in real-time and in an isolated environment.
